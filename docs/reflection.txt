This project followed the Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS) structure to build a small, reproducible data pipeline; however, completing the workflow on a Windows system was significantly more challenging than expected. Many of the provided instructions (such as make commands and assumed shell behavior) appear to be written primarily for macOS/Linux environments and do not translate cleanly to Windows. As a result, several steps required manual workarounds and additional troubleshooting that were not documented.

Despite these challenges, I successfully downloaded a public dataset, stored the raw data in the data/raw directory, and implemented a processing script that reads the raw data and writes a cleaned version to data/processed. Both raw and processed datasets were uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket for backup, consistent with the CCDS design principles.

After processing the data, I performed a simple exploratory analysis using Google Colab. The resulting analysis notebook is saved as notebooks/Third_Assignment.ipynb. While the overall structure promotes good separation of concerns and reproducibility, clearer guidance or Windows-specific instructions would substantially improve usability and reduce unnecessary friction in completing the workflow.
